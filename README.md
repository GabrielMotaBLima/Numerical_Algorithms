# Numerical Algorithms

This repository is intended for Numerical Algorithms in some programming languages, made by me at college in Numerical Algorithms subject. The algorithms that will split up for now are:

- Linear Systems
  - Gauss Elimination Method
  - Gauss Elimination Method With Pivoting
  - LU Decomposition Method
  - Cholesky Method
  - Conjugate Gradient Method
- Polinomial Interpolation 
  - Newton's Polynomial Method
  - Lagrange's Polynomial Method
- Curves Adjustments
  - Least Squares Method
- Numerical Integration
  - Newton-Cotes Formulas
    - Trapezium Rule
    - Simpsons 1/3 Rule
    - Simpsons 3/8 Rule
  - Quadrature of Gauss-Legendre
- Roots of Equations
  - Bisection Method
  - Regula Falsi Method
  - Fixed-Point Iteration
  - Pegasus Method
  - Newton-Raphson Method
  - Illinois Method (extra)
- Ordinary Differential Equations
  - Euler Method
  - Euler Modified Method
  - Runge-Kutta Method
  - Runge-Kutta Method (2nd order)
  - Dormand-Prince and Fehlberg Method
  - Dormand-Prince Modified Method
